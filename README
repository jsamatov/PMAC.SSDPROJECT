Git works same as any version control application. The commands can be slightly different but concept is the same.
But Git is lighter and faster than SVN and free hosting available at GitHub.
If you want to learn Git in details and become Pro, read this:
http://progit.org/book/

For these who have experience with SVN but just learning Git this is a good reference:

For short list of main Git commands and descriptions for daily use read here:

This is a public repository where everybody pulls our application.

Basically after you all set uo with Git and checked out our repository (git pull) the work flow now has to be as so:
You should rebase every time before starting working on the application (in the morning)
git rebase master

Then when you want to make commit to your local depository (helps you to keep record on your changes) by using 
git ci -a -m "Some message about changes you are committing"

Then after you're done with your change you have to push all the local branches (local commits) 
git push remote
